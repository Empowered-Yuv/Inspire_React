Context api prop drilling(state management) mai istemaal hota hai

react.dev 

Context api sirf react mai hai iske bahar nhi hai
Lekin context api jaisi problem kuch aur ttols solve karte hai jaise Redux, Reactredux, redux tool kit, zustand, etc.

Context api global variable mai saara data jaata hai but ek problem hai koi bhi update kr dega


Good practices 
react-router-dom package

Redux 
pehle store (single source of truth) banana hai, store to reducer btana padega

Using redux persist and PersistGate u can save the changes in the local storage
